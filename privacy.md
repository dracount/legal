# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** January 21, 2026

## Apps Covered by This Policy

This Privacy Policy applies to all mobile applications published by AppWrite Factory.

All apps share the same privacy practices as described below.

## Overview

We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our mobile applications.

## Information We Collect

### Information You Provide

Our apps may allow you to input data (such as calculations, settings, or preferences) for the app's functionality. This data is stored locally on your device only.

### Automatically Collected Information

**We do not collect any data automatically.** Our apps operate entirely offline and do not transmit any information from your device to external servers.

## How We Use Information

All calculations and data processing occur locally on your device. We do not:
- Collect personal information
- Track your location
- Access your contacts, photos, or other device data beyond what's necessary for app functionality
- Send any data to external servers
- Use analytics or tracking tools

## Data Storage

Our apps store data locally on your device using platform-standard local storage mechanisms (e.g., shared_preferences on mobile).

**This data never leaves your device** unless you explicitly export it using the app's export features.

## Third-Party Services

### In-App Purchases

Our apps use RevenueCat for in-app purchase processing. When you make a purchase:
- RevenueCat processes the transaction through Apple App Store or Google Play Store
- We do not have access to your payment information
- RevenueCat Privacy Policy: https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy

### No Other Third Parties

Our apps do NOT integrate with:
- Analytics platforms
- Advertising networks
- Social media services
- Cloud storage providers
- Any other third-party data collection services

## Children's Privacy

Our apps do not knowingly collect information from children under 13. The apps are designed for general audiences and do not require any personal information to function.

## Your Rights

Depending on your location, you may have rights regarding your personal data under GDPR, CCPA, or other privacy laws, including:
- Right to access your data
- Right to delete your data
- Right to data portability
- Right to opt-out of data sales (we don't sell data)

**Since our apps do not collect or store any personal data on our servers, these rights are automatically satisfied.** All your data stays on your device under your control.

## Data Security

Since all data stays on your device and we don't collect or transmit data, the security of your information is controlled by:
- Your device's operating system security
- Your device's physical security
- Any device-level encryption you've enabled

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by:
- Posting the new Privacy Policy on this page
- Updating the "Last Updated" date
- Providing notice in the app (for material changes)
